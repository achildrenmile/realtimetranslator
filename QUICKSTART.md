Hi Michael,

**Yes, we can provide a solution for point 1 immediately.**

**IMMEDIATE SOLUTION (Ready Today):**

For physical customer meetings, I recommend using **Microsoft Translator** on iPhone:
- FREE professional-grade app
- Real-time Chinese ↔ English translation
- Conversation mode for face-to-face meetings
- Works offline with downloaded language packs
- Download: App Store → "Microsoft Translator"

**Setup time:** 2 minutes  
**Quality:** Professional-grade, used by Fortune 500 companies

**PC ALTERNATIVE:**

We've also developed a Python-based real-time translator for PC/laptop use:
- Real-time microphone translation
- Display on projector/screen for meetings
- Bidirectional Chinese ↔ English
- Setup time: 10 minutes

**NEXT STEPS:**

1. Download Microsoft Translator on your iPhone today

3. Use in your next customer meeting
4. (Optional) Set up PC solution for office meetings

Both solutions are ready for immediate deployment.

For point 2 (Webex/Teams integration), we'll need to develop a custom solution. Let me know if you'd like us to pursue that.
